# jrnl_snap
Snap of jrnl. The original source is availble at https://github.com/jrnl-org/jrnl
Note: you must use jrnl-sh instead of jrnl. I couldn't figure out how to fix this. It happens because I can't use jrnl as the snap name.
Storing the encryption password in your keychain isn't working/implemented; I don't know how to do it.
